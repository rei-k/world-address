official_position:
  japan: |
    The Senkaku Islands are clearly an inherent part of Japanese territory, in 
    light of historical facts and based upon international law. Indeed, the Senkaku 
    Islands are under the valid control of Japan. There exists no issue of territorial 
    sovereignty to be resolved concerning the Senkaku Islands.
  
  china: |
    Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands have been China's inherent territory 
    since ancient times. China has indisputable sovereignty over Diaoyu Dao. 
    Japan's so-called "incorporation" of the islands is illegal and invalid.
  
  taiwan: |
    The Diaoyutai Islands are part of the territory of the Republic of China. 
    Historical records, geography and international law all support ROC sovereignty 
    over these islands.
